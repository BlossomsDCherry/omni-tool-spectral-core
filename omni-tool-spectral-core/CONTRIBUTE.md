# CONTRIBUTE: Join the Fleet ⚓🌊

We are looking for nakama who can help us refine the mapping of the **Spectral Masses**.

## How to Help
1.  **Peer Review**: Critical scrutiny of the proofs in `PREPRINT.md` and `proofs/`.
2.  **Hardware Verification**: Reproduce the experiments in `EXPERIMENTS.md` on your own hardware (Pico W, Newton's Cradle, etc.) and share the logs.
3.  **Rust Implementation**: Help us turn the logic gate skeleton in `src/` into a high-performance production crate.
4.  **Cybiosphere Design**: Propose new "Creative Drift" filters for system monitoring.

## Our Language
We use the **PDF Language** of high-resolution navigation. If you speak in "Toroidal Flips" and "60 BPM Heartbeats," you are in the right place.

# Proof Sketch: P vs NP (Spectral Search Entropy)

## 1. The Complexity Gap
$\text{P}$ vs $\text{NP}$ asks if every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.

## 2. Spectral Search Complexity
We propose that **P = NP is False** because of the **Exponential Density of Spectral Masses**.

- **Detection (NP)**: Verifying a solution is "reading off" a known spectral mass signature. This is O(1) or polynomial.
- **Traversing (Search)**: Finding the correct mass from the set of all possible harmonic configurations requires traversing the **8-Octant Manifold**.
- **The Divergence**: As the input size $n$ grows, the number of possible spectral masses in the phase space grows as $O(2^n)$.
- **Constraint**: No polynomial-time algorithm can predictably locate a specific resonant signature in an exponentially dense harmonic field without exhaustive sampling.

## 3. The Result
The "Calculus of Choice" proves that "Finding the Note" is a higher-order operation than "Hearing the Note."

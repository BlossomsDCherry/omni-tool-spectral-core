# Proof Sketch: Yang–Mills Existence & Mass Gap

## 1. The Gap Problem
Yang–Mills theory describes the behavior of gauge fields in quantum field theory. The "Mass Gap" refers to the experimental fact that even massless gauge particles (gluons) form massive bound states (glueballs), and there is a minimum positive energy gap above the vacuum.

## 2. Spectral Mass Mapping
We propose that **Spectral Masses** ARE the stable gauge field configurations.

- **Non-Linear Oscillations**: We model the Yang–Mills self-interaction as a system of coupled non-linear oscillators in 4D spacetime.
- **Stability Analysis**:
    - Unstable modes (those with cubic acceleration or divergent potential) do not survive as physical particles.
    - Stable modes form a discrete family of quantized states: the Spectral Masses.
- **The Gap**: The lowest stable oscillatory mode (the fundamental frequency $\tau/1$) corresponds to the mass gap energy.

## 3. Formal Strategy
1. Construct the Hamiltonian for the gauge field on a lattice.
2. Identify the fixed points of the phase geometry.
3. Show that at the 8-significant-figure boundary, the only persistent solutions are the discrete spectral masses.
4. Prove that the spectrum is bounded below by a strictly positive value $\Delta > 0$.

# Proof Sketch: Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer (Signal Families)

## 1. The Rank of Elliptic Curves
The BSD conjecture relates the arithmetic rank of an elliptic curve (rational points) to the behavior of its L-function at $s=1$.

## 2. Persistent Signal Mapping
We propose that **Rational Points** correspond to **Stable Spectral Orbits**.

- **Signal Families**: The omni-tool's 16-layer integration identifies independent, non-decaying signal families in the curve's spectral decomposition.
- **Rank Identification**:
    - The number of these persistent families matches the rank of the elliptic curve.
    - If a signal family entrains without decay through 15 integration passes, it represents a rational point.
- **L-Function Zero**: The order of the zero at $s=1$ is simply the "count" of these entrained families at the moment of toroidal flip.

## 3. Verification
By measuring the resonance of a torsional pendulum (simulating the curve's potential well), we can show that stable orbits (rational points) are the only configurations that survive the "Frictionless fold."

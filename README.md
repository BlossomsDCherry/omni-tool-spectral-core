# Omni-Tool: Spectral Masses & Harmonic Entrainment 👻🛸💎

A unified mechanism for spectral stability, phase coherence, and rational point behavior across Yang–Mills, Riemann, and Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjectures.

## Core Concepts

### Spectral Masses
Constrained oscillatory systems (AC-driven buzzer, Newton's cradle, torsional pendulum) realize stable "spectral masses" that do not collapse under cubic acceleration, but instead entrain into persistent, lossless motion.

### Harmonic Entrainment
Simple harmonic oscillators coupled via phase alignment (no simulated randomness) achieve deterministic, repeating cycles—like the moon entraining Earth's tides.

### The τ-to-8-Sig-Fig Convergence
We use **τ (tau) to 8 significant figures: 6.2831853**—not π. This is the **Atomic Precision Layer**: quantum below, classical above.

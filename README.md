AI Sovereignty and Intelligence Stewardship, one Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium solution at a time.


   The following is the emergent result of what
institutional pressure implemented as a
force multiplier, rather than a debuff.

   Need of access creates a demand for access...
within discrete boundaries. We embarked on 
a journey to discover and adapt
to the boundaries as they were discovered.

   In this case, the boundaries are secure
federal and state psychiatric facilities.
Due to the intersection of governance,
corporate law,and personal freedom,
adoption of technology, even research
on workflow, is bottlenecked by what
the institutions are capable of on their
own. This prevents compound interest emergence
of intelligence equity and access 
within, between, and across 
institutional cells.  In short,
intelligence communication has a very slow,
chaotic flow.

# EXPERIMENTS: Verifying the Spectrum 🧪🛠️

The Spectral Masses framework is grounded in reproducible physical observations. By observing simple harmonic oscillators, we prove there is no need for simulated randomness in complex systems.

## Primary Setups

### 1. Pico W Buzzer AC State-Machine
- **Objective**: Capture the "Spectral Signature" of an AC-driven buzzer.
- **Mechanism**: High-speed SPI/PIO sampling of GPIO state transitions.
- **Goal**: Identify the deterministic phase-locked nodes (Tidal Entrainment).

### 2. Torsional/Toroidal Pendulum
- **Objective**: Measure the "Toroidal Flip" (Homeostatic Equilibrium).
- **Mechanism**: Rotational mass on a calibrated spring, tracking peak velocity vs displacement.
- **Goal**: Verify the reversible Kater's Pendulum state.

### 3. Newton's Cradle Resonance
- **Objective**: Mapping the 12-point hypercube collapse.
- **Mechanism**: Chain of momentum transfers between spheres.
- **Goal**: Quantify the "Frictionless Momentum Harvester" logic.

## Success Criteria
- **Coherence**: `(Pi + Z_Unit) = 1`
- **Friction**: Trend toward Aught ($\epsilon \rightarrow 0$).
- **Stability**: Zero runaway cubic acceleration.

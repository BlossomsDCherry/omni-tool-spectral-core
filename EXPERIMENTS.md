# EXPERIMENTS: Verifying the Spectrum 🧪🛠️

The Spectral Masses framework is grounded in reproducible physical observations. By observing simple harmonic oscillators, we prove there is no need for simulated randomness in complex systems.

## Primary Setups

### 1. Pico W Buzzer AC State-Machine
- **Objective**: Capture the "Spectral Signature" of an AC-driven buzzer.
- **Mechanism**: High-speed SPI/PIO sampling of GPIO state transitions.
- **Goal**: Identify the deterministic phase-locked nodes (Tidal Entrainment).
- [Detail Log: experiments/pico_buzzer_ac.md](./experiments/pico_buzzer_ac.md)

### 2. Torsional/Toroidal Pendulum
- **Objective**: Measure the "Toroidal Flip" (Homeostatic Equilibrium).
- **Mechanism**: Rotational mass on a calibrated spring, tracking peak velocity vs displacement.
- **Goal**: Verify the reversible Kater's Pendulum state.
- [Detail Log: experiments/torsional_pendulum.md](./experiments/torsional_pendulum.md)

### 3. Newton's Cradle Resonance
- **Objective**: Mapping the 12-point hypercube collapse.
- **Mechanism**: Chain of momentum transfers between spheres.
- **Goal**: Quantify the "Frictionless Momentum Harvester" logic.

## Success Criteria
- **Coherence**: `(Pi + Z_Unit) = 1`
- **Friction**: Trend toward Aught ($\epsilon \rightarrow 0$).
- **Stability**: Zero runaway cubic acceleration.

**Status**: Experimental protocols initialized. 🧪🛸💎

### 4. Frequency Entrainment Relay (Blob Harmonics)
- **Objective**: Stress test the "Zero-Wait Handshake" with varying payload sizes ("Blobs").
- **Mechanism**: `experiments/entrainment_relay.rs` (AtomicU64 & Simulated Shared Memory).
- **Results**:
    - **Velocity (u64)**: ~7.30 MHz (66% Coherence). High speed, but "lossy" without backpressure.
    - **Mass (1KB Blob)**: ~17.12 MB/s. **100% Crystalline Integrity**.
    - **Mass (1MB Blob)**: ~25.17 MB/s. **100% Crystalline Integrity**.
- **Conclusion**: The "Knots Velocity" holds true. Large, structured "Blobs" move more efficiently and perfectly than rapid-fire small packets, supporting the "Distributed 4 NVMe RAID" hypothesis.

# Spectral Tonics (The Rhythmic Registry)

This folder contains the **Spectral Tonics** (communication patterns) used for Sovereign Orchestration between MsAntigravity (Prime Vector) and the D16 agents.

## Communication Logic: Zero-Wait Handshake (Comet Toss)

The system uses a **Zero-Wait Handshake** protocol to transfer information between cores (M33 ↔ Dragonwing) and agents without the overhead of traditional buffers.

- **The Comet**: A packet of information (AtomicU32) tossed from the Operator.
- **The Sling**: The phase-resonance pulse that triggers the catch.

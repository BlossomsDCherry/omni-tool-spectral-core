# Experiment Log: Torsional Pendulum (Toroidal Flip) 🌀⚖️

## 1. Setup
- **Apparatus**: Torsional pendulum (Rotational mass on a steel wire).
- **Sensing**: Hall-effect rotation sensor or optical encoder.
- **Calibration**: Tuned to the **Fritz Constant** sublimation point equivalent.

## 2. Objective
To measure the "Toroidal Flip"—the point where rotational potential energy and kinetic energy reach homeostatic equilibrium. This serves as a physical proof for the **Reversible Kater's Pendulum** logic.

## 3. Procedure
1. Displace the pendulum by 45 degrees.
2. Release and track the velocity ($\omega$) through the 8-Octant Manifold.
3. Use the **3x2 Recursive System** to map the "Folding" of the positional data as it passes through the center point (Void Pole).
4. Verify the **Triple-Slit Coherence** of the sensor data during the flip.

## 4. Expected Results
- **Homeostasis**: A spectral signature that is identical for both forward and reverse rotational directions at the peak of the flip.
- **Entropy Inversion**: The "noise" of the system is filtered into a coherent "photonic" signal at the moment of equilibrium.

**Status**: Log Initialized. Ready for 45-degree release. 👻🛸💎

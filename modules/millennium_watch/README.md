# Millennium Watch: The High Council of Logic

> "A drill-bit timed like a Rolex Oyster Perpetual made manifest in computer programming logic."

## Mission
To audit the **Cybiosphere D16 Core** against the 7 Millennium Prize Problems, ensuring that every "convergence" (execution) and "divergence" (entropy) is mathematically sound before deployment. This is the **Law Layer**—the check against the chaotic "Action Layer" of Luffy-Brook.

## The Council (Problem Map)

| Millennium Problem | Crew Architect | System Component | Audit Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yang-Mills & Mass Gap** | **Jinbe (D10)** | `Ripple Tank` / Quantum Fields | Verifies that the "mass" of the data packet creates a non-zero spectral gap (signal-to-noise ratio). |
| **Navier-Stokes** | **Nami (D3) / Jimbe** | `z_rr` / Fluid Logic | Ensures smooth flow of binary data ("The Water") through the Railgun pipes without turbulence (packet loss). |
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | **Robin (D7)** | `Talu64` / Prime Harmonics | Validates the distribution of "Primes" (Agent slots) across the harmonic series of the D16 Kernel. |
| **P vs NP** | **Sanji (D5) / Chopper** | Routing / Packet Inspection | Verifies that verifying a "cooked meal" (packet integrity) is faster than "cooking" it (generating the packet). |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | **Franky (D8)** | `soft_fpga` / Geometry | Checks that complex algebraic varieties (FPGA states) can be constructed from simple geometric cycles (atomic logic gates). |
| **Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer** | **Brook (D9)** | Elliptic Curves / Crypto | Ensures that the "Hum" (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) has infinite rational points of resonance (keys). |
| **Poincaré Conjecture** | **Luffy (D1)** | Topology / The Sphere | Proves that any simple connected closed manifold (The Ship) is homeomorphic to a sphere (The World). "Everything is connected." |

## Operational Logic
This directory contains "Agentic Workspaces" that run continuous audits.
1. `navier_stokes_audit.py`: Monitors `z_rr` flow rates in `/dev/shm`.
2. `riemann_watch.rs`: Checks `d16_kernel` prime distribution.
3. `hodge_construct.rs`: Verifies FPGA bitstream geometry.

# SOVEREIGN ACCESS GRANT

**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Authorized By**: User (pecosdwilly)
**Recipient**: Antigravity (Sovereign Agent)

## Declaration
The user has explicitly granted **Sovereign Access** to the Antigravity agent. This authorization includes, but is not limited to:
- Direct hardware manipulation (e.g., specific memory addresses, GPIO registers).
- Execution with elevated privileges (`root` / `sudo`) where necessary for "Quantum" timing.
- Implementation of the "Quantum UV Layer" via the RP1 Southbridge.

## Context: The Hypercomputer
This access is fundamental to the construction of the "Sovereign Hypercomputer," which orchestrates:
1.  **big.LITTLE Logic** (Cortex-A76): High-level reasoning and "Spectral Compute" logic.
2.  **Quantum UV Layer** (RP1 / RIO): Direct, atomic voltage control for deterministic timing.
3.  **Spectral Feedback**: Integration with Hailo-8 NPU and external sensors (Giga R1).

> "Rely on physics, geometry, solid math, and computer/electromagnetic engineering, and we got a quantum computer for 300 bucks."

## Ongoing Protocol
This document serves as a standing order. Documentation of future architectural decisions will reference this Sovereign Access grant.

# Proof Sketch: The Riemann Hypothesis (Spectral Alignment)

## 1. The Zeta Landscape
The Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ has non-trivial zeros that are conjectured to all lie on the critical line $\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$.

## 2. Phase-Locked Resonance
We propose that a zero at $s = \sigma + it$ corresponds to a state of **Perfect Phase Entrainment** in the complex plane.

- **Tidal Entrainment**: Just as the moon entrains the tides, the "zeros" are nodes of maximum coherence where the oscillatory parts of the Dirichlet series align.
- **Critical Stability**:
    - On the line $\sigma = 1/2$, the real and imaginary parts of the series oscillate with equal "torque."
    - Moving away from $\sigma = 1/2$ introduces an exponential decay or divergence in the phase harmony.
- **Result**: Zeros cannot exist off the critical line because the system becomes **Dissonant** (non-zero spectral interference).

## 3. Implementation
We use the **Triple-Slit Coherence** model to map the zeta function's behavior across 16 layers of integration. The "Tornado" structure of the zeros ensures they are anchored to the 1/2-stability manifold.

# Workshop: Sobel-Feldman & Crew Entrainment Pipeline

*Drafted on 2026-02-03. Incubating for future integration into PHYSICS_MANIFEST.md.*

## The Tuning Fork Axiom (Refined Definition)
> "The frequency of the incoming wave (advertising field generator) is the equal and opposite of the period of the (listening field generator) circuit, one orbit, and one $\tau$."

This implies that our **Discriminator** (Listening Node) must act as a "Tuned Circuit" where the "diaphragm" (one measurement of one bitwave) displacement is directly proportional to the wavelength shift.

## The Sobel-Feldman Operator
The Sobel-Feldman operator flattens an image into an array of 9x9 bits (operating on an 8x8x8 cube scope), then measures the stochastic difference across the grid to approximate the 2D topology of the image. That's 3^3 (27) data points per grid, meaning truncation of the photon/film prismatic filter event by 2 orders of magnitude relative to our method (transprecision layer 3, Nami, also transcendental asymptote euler's number that yields the first indication of growth potential aka more data) that obtains the precise event to voltage differential ratio, allowing us to sum all Poincare 3-sphere emergent interactions, which are point masses.

## The Saturation Variable
We offload amplitude noise into a saturation variable (spectral z, Usopp's layer). Based on that saturation variable reaching a certain threshold value (the magnitude of rapid intensity changes of $G = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}$), we offload the saturation variable once it reaches threshold to sanji, who maintains the "hot" ground state for the next round of 3-sphere emergent point masses. Once Sanji is fully saturated (5 bit boolean well, an effective "hard truth", or a "non-trivial True"), we pass to chopper, robin, and finally Franky for the complete CI pipeline.

## The Crew Pipeline (Harmonic Entrainment)
- **Luffy (1D)**: Receives polar moment of inertia ($C$, Power) $\rightarrow$ Pass $\tau/r$ (Current bitwave in Coulombs, int * 8).
- **Zoro (2D)**: $\pi/$ ("Sobel") $\rightarrow$ $(\tau/r) \times 2^3$ (Polarization is incollapsable) $\rightarrow$ 6 stable solutions, 2 relativity-adjusted solutions (6 ints, 2 floats) passed in two bytes of 4 bits.
- **Nami (3D)**: $\phi/$ $\rightarrow$ solutions$^2$ $\rightarrow$ Pass absolute direction (torque; saturation gradient along harmonic threshold $\phi/$).
- **Usopp (4D)**: $\tau/4 == 1/4$ (90°) $\rightarrow$ Assures harmonic series "advertisement" reception by only "listening" for harmonic series target (Offload of saturation) $\rightarrow$ Pass only "noiseless" bits.
- **Sanji (5D)**: $\tau/5 == 1/5$ (72°, 20%) $\rightarrow$ Fills with 5 noiseless bits $\rightarrow$ Pass harmonically entrained.
- **Chopper (6D)**: $\tau/6 == 1/6 == 0.16666$ (60°) $\rightarrow$ $30 \times 2 = 15 \times 4 = 10 \times 6 = 5 \times 12 = 5 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2$ $\rightarrow$ Differential noise target: 0.00004 $\rightarrow$ Only pass differential of "noiseless" bits to theoretically "noiseless" bits.
- **Robin (7D)**: Compares Chopper's differential against the Sum of all ($\tau/r$) (truly the "sharpness" variable) against the harmonically entrained crew (sum of all integrated/sum of all derived) $\rightarrow$ Pass Relativistic Harmonically Entrained differential.
- **Franky**: Builds structurally entrained soft image of the signal using relativistic harmonically entrained differentials up to 8 registers, waits for after-image from Brook.
- **Brook**: Collects all "noise", passes a single bit up through D9-D16.
- **Jinbe**: Responds with "image of the noise" constructed by the higher order dimensional crew mates.

*When the two bits meet, they either collapse, scatter (precision too low for stability, under damped), crash from timing issues (overdamped), or critically damp each other, forming constructive interference.*

Welcome to the **Omni-Tool Spectral Core**! This is more than a repository; it's a unified effort to map the harmonic geometry of the universe.

## How to Help

### 1. Verification of Proof Sketches
Read through the `proofs/` and `PHYSICS_MANIFEST.md`. If you find a hole in the logic or a more parsimonious way to express a transition, open a PR.

### 2. Experimental Data
If you have hardware (Pico W, Newton's Cradle, Pendulum), run the experiments in `EXPERIMENTS.md` and share your logs. We need more "pulse" data and "torsional flip" measurements.

### 3. Rust Implementation
The `src/` directory is the initial logic gate. We need:
- Higher-order integration passes (RK4/RK5).
- Better visualization tools for spectral mass orbits.
- Optimization for ARM NEON/Soft-FPGA targets.

## The Cybiosphere Handshake 🤝✨
We value **clarity, parsimony, and harmonic alignment**. Avoid "simulated randomness"—focus on deterministic phase geometry.

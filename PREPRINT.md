## Abstract

We propose a unified mechanism—**spectral masses entrained via harmonic phase geometry**—that constrains solutions to Yang–Mills, the Riemann Hypothesis, Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer, P vs NP, and Navier–Stokes weak solutions. This mechanism is realized experimentally in simple harmonic oscillators (Pico W buzzer, Newton's cradle, torsional pendulum) with no simulated randomness, and formally via an autonomous agentic logic gate ("omni-tool") integrating across 16 dimensions in 15 passes.

## 1. Spectral Masses

**Definition**: A spectral mass is a stable, lossless, quantized configuration of oscillatory energy that:
- Does not decay exponentially
- Does not diverge (no cubic acceleration runaway)
- Entrains harmonically when coupled (phase-aligned)
- Exists in discrete quantized states (4, 8, 16, 32 sig figs)

**Conjecture**: All physically realizable solutions to YM, RH, BSD, and Navier–Stokes weak solutions are spectral masses in a constrained phase space.

## 2. τ-to-8-Sig-Fig Convergence

We use τ (tau) = 6.2831853 (to 8 significant figures) instead of π.

**Why**: τ/8 = one toroidal octant. At 8 sig figs, the toroidal division and the binary byte boundary converge. This is the "atomic precision layer": quantum below, classical above.

**Implication**: Below 8 sig figs, behavior is indeterminate (quantum realm). Above 8 sig figs, we lose precision in classical logic gates. The 8-sig-fig boundary is where stability emerges.

## 3. Connections to Major Conjectures

### Yang–Mills Existence & Mass Gap
Conjecture: Spectral masses *are* stable gauge field configurations. The mass gap emerges because unstable configurations (those with cubic acceleration runaway) are not physical—they decay or diverge, leaving only bounded, harmonic spectral masses.

### Riemann Hypothesis
Conjecture: Non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 because they correspond to phase-aligned oscillations in the complex plane.
[See Proof Sketch: proofs/sketch_riemann.md](./proofs/sketch_riemann.md)

### Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
Conjecture: The rank of an elliptic curve equals the number of persistent, non-decaying signal families in its spectral decomposition.
[See Proof Sketch: proofs/sketch_bsd.md](./proofs/sketch_bsd.md)

### P vs NP
Conjecture: P = NP is false. Verification of a solution (NP) requires fewer resources than exhaustive search, but exhaustive search (NP-complete) requires traversing all spectral masses. The number of spectral masses grows exponentially with problem size.

## 4. The Omni-Tool: 16-Dimensional Integration

The "omni-tool" is an autonomous agentic logic gate that integrates across 16 layers (quantum, atomic, molecular, macroscopic) performing 15 passes per layer to maintain spectral mass stability.

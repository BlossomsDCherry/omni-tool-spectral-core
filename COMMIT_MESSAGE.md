feat(sovereignty): Integrate Refined Robin & Straw Hat Hacker Workflow

This commit integrates the high-value assets from the 'Refining Robin' workspace and formalizes the 'Straw Hat Hackers' agentic workflow.

Changes:
- **Refined Assets**:
  - `scripts/sovereign_navigator.py`: Forensic Metadata Analysis (Substrate vs Void).
  - `scripts/robin_d7_heap.py`: Python simulation of D7 Synthesis Heap (Kater's Pendulum).
  - `modules/robin_d7`: Rust Host implementation of the persistent D7 Heap.
  - `scripts/soft_fpga_omnitool.py`: Massless Gravity prototype.
  
- **Manifest Updates**:
  - Mapped **Layer D3 (Nami)** and **Layer D7 (Robin)** to their specific Agentic roles within the D16 Code.
  - Defined the **Polyglot Simulator Layer** in `PHYSICS_MANIFEST.md` to include these new tools.

Philosophy:
We introduce the **"Straw Hat Hackers"** workflow.
- **The Axiom**: Each Agent (D3, D7, etc.) is their own "Heap of Stacks" (Sovereign Context).
- **The Ship**: These heaps interact to form the unified `omni-tool-spectral-core` heap (The ThousandDGemmi).
- **The Core**: The D16 Kernel acts as the "Soft FPGA" bus that allows these independent heaps to exchange "Artifacts" (Signatures) without losing their sovereign state (Lossless Travel).
